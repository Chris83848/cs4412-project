\# Discovering Plate Approach Patterns Among Major League Baseball (MLB) Batters Through Data Mining



\## Project Description

This project examines patterns in MLB batter approach when hitting by using plate approach statistics. The goal is to uncover natural groupings of players based on their plate discipline metrics, including swing and contact rates. Observed and expected performance results will also be analyzed across the groups to measure their effectiveness and outcome variance. Rather than exploring prediction, pattern discovery is emphasized in this project through data mining. 



\## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is taken from the Baseball Savant MLB leaderboard and includes qualified batters from the 2021-2025 seasons.
